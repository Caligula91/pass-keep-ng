Angular version 11.1.2.

## About PassKeep

If you are tired of forgetting passwords and pin-codes, then this app is for you.

Signup, create personal pin-code and start using app. Add account from different platforms to your list.

Everytime you want to see password, you need to enter personal pin-code. Pin-code is blocked if you type wrong 4 times.

## Security

Passwords are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard. You will receive password only when you provide valid pin-code.

Pin-code should be kept only in your head. Pin-code can be reset anytime using user's password.

## Future Plans

1. Implement NgRx (I curse myself why I didn't do it at the begining of development)
2. Email verification on every signin from different IP
3. Implement refresh token
4. Rate limit for specific routes (better security)
5. Improve CSS style
